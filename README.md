# Layout exercise

Based on this project, you now need to implement the following layout.

<img src="./images/demo.png" alt="demo"/>

There are a few ways in which you could achieve some of these tasks, and there often isn't a single right or wrong way to do things.
The tasks you need to achieve are:

- To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.
- The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.
- The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.
- The **article** and **aside** elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.
- The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.

You will not need to edit the HTML in order to achieve this layout and the techniques you should use are:<

- Positioning
- Float
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid Layout
